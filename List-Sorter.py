""" Sort a list

Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first will be a list of numbers. 
The second parameter will be a string that can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none.

If the second parameter is “asc,” then the function should return a list with the numbers in ascending order. 
If it’s “desc,” then the list should be in descending order, and if it’s “none,” it should return the original list unaltered. """
